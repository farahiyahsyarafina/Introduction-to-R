# Factors

## What's a factor and why would you use it?
```R
# Assign to the variable theory what this chapter is about!
theory = "factors for categorical variables"
```

## What's a factor and why would you use it? (2)
```R
# Gender vector
gender_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")

# Convert gender_vector to a factor
factor_gender_vector <- factor (gender_vector)

# Print out factor_gender_vector
factor_gender_vector
```
Output
```{bash}
[1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  Levels: Female Male
```

## Factor levels
```R
```

## Summarizing a factor
```R
# Build factor_survey_vector with clean levels
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
factor_survey_vector

# Generate summary for survey_vector
summary (survey_vector)

# Generate summary for factor_survey_vector
summary(factor_survey_vector)
```
```{bash}
Female   Male 
     2      3
```

## Battle of sexes
```R
# Build factor_survey_vector with clean levels
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")

# Male
male <- factor_survey_vector[1]

# Female
female <- factor_survey_vector[2]

# Battle of the sexes: Male 'larger' than female?
male > female
```
```{bash}
[1] NA
```

## Ordered factor
```R
# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("fast", "slow", "slow", "fast", "insane")
```

# Ordered factor (2)
```R
# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("fast", "slow", "slow", "fast", "insane")

# Convert speed_vector to ordered factor vector
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("slow", "fast", "insane"))

# Print factor_speed_vector
factor_speed_vector
summary(factor_speed_vector)
```
```{bash}
slow   fast insane 
     2      2      1
```

## Comparing ordered factors
```R
# Create factor_speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("fast", "slow", "slow", "fast", "insane")
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("slow", "fast", "insane"))

# Factor value for second data analyst
da2 <- factor_speed_vector[2]

# Factor value for fifth data analyst
da5 <- factor_speed_vector[5]

# Is data analyst 2 faster than data analyst 5?
da2 > da5
```
Output
```{bash}
[1] FALSE
```
